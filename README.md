## Nand2Tetris

This is a collection of all the projects I have done for the open course called [Nand2Tetris](http://nand2tetris.org/). I will try to complete one project each week and write down thinkings and ideas based on my experience of doing these projects. This collection of posts is mainly suppose to be a self references for my future self. Although, any comments, suggestions or corrections are greatly welcome!
